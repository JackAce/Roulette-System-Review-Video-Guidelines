This is a full 1920x1080 graphic of the Roulette Betting Layout. It does not need to be resized or repositioned on a 1920x1080 video.

This starts out as a blank background, but will display ALL betting levels represented with a single casino chip. The chip will display the bet amount total for the betting tier and each tier will increase from left to right.
