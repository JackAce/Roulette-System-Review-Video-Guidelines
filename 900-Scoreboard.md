# Scoreboard

This is one of the top most layers.

|X|Y|Scale|

|960|540|100%|

There are usually 3 versions of this image:

* `scoreboard-00-blank.png` - The blank scoreboard with no title or other text
* `scoreboard-01-title.png` - Just the name of the system (and sometimes the name of the author)
* `scoreboard-02-headers.png` - The title AND headers showing "Last:" and "Trial Total:" or "Running Total:"

This only needs to update when the system name is mentioned (b-title) and on the first spin (c-headers).

## scoreboard-00-blank.png

This is displayed at the beginning of the video

## scoreboard-01-title.png

This should be displayed via 10 frame cross fade when the system's title is mentioned

## scoreboard-02-headers.png

This should be displayed when the first ball lands and the *CHIME* is played in the app. After this, it should ALWAYS be displayed.
